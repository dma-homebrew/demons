TODO:
- all license to source files
- check that init stairs does not get stuck in infinite loop

BUGS:
- if player dies with score 0, double "00" is printed

IDEAS:
- zap sound
- add sound to win game effect
- poisoned condition (snakes), hearts turn green
- print level numbers when descending and leveling up
- dark level (line of sight limited to adjacent cells)
- water / lava tiles
- frozen/slowed monster condition (cyan color)
- keys, open locked doors
- cloak: gives extra health? protects against poison?
- item that resurrects player once with 1 heart
- RNG is terrible, same levels can repeat during a play session (only 256 different levels)
