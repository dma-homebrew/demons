Demons of Dex
A roguelike for the unexpanded VIC-20

level generation:
- start with a level filled with walls
- random walker carves tunnels, turns at map edges

monsters & items:
- no per-instance data structures, state of object is coded into screen ram
- monsters have no health! random chance of killing (affected by per-type armor rating)
- monster variations: green orc, grey orc?
- wounded monsters can be visualized with red color
- monster ai: fullscreen pass that updates screen ram
- scrolls & potions: effect is determined by color ram
- items are picked up by walking over them

// monster type definition
struct Monster
{
	uint8_t damage;		// how much damage the monster deals
	uint8_t	armor;		// how difficult it is to kill the monster
	uint8_t speed;		// how often monster is updated (every nth update)
	uint8_t flags;		// misc flags (special abilities)
	char	name[8];
};

animated tiles (update char ram):
- gold twinkle
- water/lava vertical scrolling
- monster animation by mirroring char data (how to efficiently do bit reverse?)

vic specs:
- normal screen size is 22x23 chars
- number of columns can be extended to 27
- chars can be doubled vertically to 8x16
- screen ram location 7680
- color ram location 38400-38911

- only one level can be stored in memory, therefore can't go back to previously level
