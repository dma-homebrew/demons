# Demons of Dex - Eino's Quest

A roguelike for the unexpanded VIC-20  
Copyright (C) 2015 Petri Häkkinen

You are Eino, a member of the druids. Your master, the arch druid has become old and it is time for somebody to replace him. As a young initiate you are sent to dungeon Dex, a mysterious labyrinth home to vile creatures. You must enter the dungeon alone and defeat three demon lords within. Only then can you achieve enlightenment and ascend to become the next arch druid.

Good luck!

### How to play?

Use W,A,S,D keys to move. Attack by walking on enemies. Items are automatically picked up when you walk on them.

Items that you have picked up can be used by pressing the following keys:

F1 - use potion  
F3 - use gem (F2 in the Javascript version)  
F5 - use scroll (F3 in the Javascript version)  
F7 - use ankh (F4 in the Javascript version)  
Z  - use staff  

### What do the symbols on the screen mean?

```@```  Eino (that's you!)  
```>```  Stairs to next level  
```!```  Potion  
```?```  Scroll  
```+```  Door  

Monsters are depicted by letters. There are also other symbols not listed here, find out yourselves what they are!

### Treasures of Dex

During your adventure you may find treasures which can be used by pressing a key. Some of them are dropped by monsters, some you will have to find!

**Potion (F1):** These are depicted by red '!' symbols. Drink a potion to heal your wounds by pressing F1.

**Gem (F3):** These rare precious stones have magical powers. If you are lucky to find a gem (depicted by a green diamond symbol), you can use its magical powers by pressing F3 (F2 on Javascript emulator version).

**Scroll (F5):** The scrolls with arcane words written on them have been created by evil mages lurking in the deepest chambers of Dex. A scroll looks like a purple '?' symbol on the screen. You can unleash the spells stored in them by pressing F5 (F3 on Javascript emulator version).

**Ankh (F7):** The demons of Dex have stolen the holy ankhs of the circle. The ankhs are really rare, but if you manage to recover one, you can unleash its destructive powers by pressing F7 (F4 on Javascript emulator version).

**Staff (Z):** Only the one possessing this magical artifact can become the new arch druid. It is a truly powerful item and you may use its powers by pressing the Z key. Beware, even its powers may be limited.

### Scoring

Your score increases when you do one of the following:

+10 for each monster defeated.  
+100 for each item found.  
+1000 for each demon banished.  

### Leveling up

When you defeat enemies you will get experience points. After a certain amount of experience points Eino will level up. As this happens Eino's health will be replenished. Your maximum health capacity will also gradually expand as you gain levels.
