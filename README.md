A roguelike for the unexpanded VIC-20
Copyright (C) 2015 Petri HÃ¤kkinen

You are Eino, a member of the druids.
Your master, the arch druid has become
old and it is time for somebody to replace
him. As a young initiate you are sent to
dungeon Dex, a mysterious labyrinth and
a home to vile creatures. You must enter
the dungeon alone and defeat three demon
lords within. Only then can you achieve
true enlightenment and ascend to become
the next arch druid.

Good luck!
