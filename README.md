A roguelike for the unexpanded VIC-20
Copyright (C) 2015 Petri HÃ¤kkinen

You are Eino, a member of the druids. Your master, the arch druid has become old and it is time for somebody to replace him. As a young initiate you are sent to dungeon Dex, a mysterious labyrinth home to vile creatures. You must enter the dungeon alone and defeat three demon lords within. Only then can you achieve enlightenment and ascend to become the next arch druid.

Good luck!

### Treasures of Dex

During your adventure you may find treasures which can be really helpful in fulfilling your quest. Some of them are dropped by monsters, some you will have to find!

**Potion (F1):** These are depicted by red '!' characters. Drink a potion to heal your wounds by pressing F1.

**Gem (F3):** These rare precious stones have magical powers. If you are lucky to find one, depicted by a green diamond character, you can use its magical powers by pressing F3.

**Scroll (F5):** The scrolls left behind by evil mages lurking in the deepest chambers of Dex have arcane words written on them. They look like purple '?' characters on the screen. You can unleash the spells stored in them by pressing F5.

**Ankh (F7):** The demons of Dex have stolen the holy ankhs of the circle. The ankhs are really rare, but if you manage to recover one, you can unleash its destructive powers by pressing F7.

**Staff (Z):** Only the one possessing this magical artifact can become the new arch druid. It is a very potent artifact and you may use its powers by pressing the Z key. Beware it may have limited number of uses.

+10 for each monster defeated.
+100 for each item found.
